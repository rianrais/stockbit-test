# stockbit-test
This is a public repository for the test question from stockbit.

Some of the module is using go.mod so ensure that your Golang version is able to support this.

## Usage

First, ensure that you are in the correct folder (which is separated by which question it denotes to) and then simply run the go program.

Example:

```bash
cd question3
go run answer.go
```

For the REST API question, do the same as above but instead run `go run main.go` and then use API platform (such as Postman) to hit the endpoint with the required query parameters.
